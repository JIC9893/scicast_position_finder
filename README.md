Instructions

1. Log in to SciCast.
2. Visit the following link:
https://scicast.org/trades/?user_id=UID&include_current_probs=False
replacing the letters UID with your user ID.  
2. Copy the text located at this link into a file name 'trades.txt' and save it in the same directory as the trade analyzer.  
3. Type "ruby trade_analyzer.rb" into the console.  You'll need a recent version of Ruby (1.9.0 or later), which you can download here: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/

This will create two files: position.tsv shows your net position for each question you've edited, and edits.tsv shows each of your trades.

Please let me know of any bugs, issues, or requests at bengolden1@gmail.com

Feel free to make any adjustments to this code, but please share with the SciCast community.  Google group here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scicasters
